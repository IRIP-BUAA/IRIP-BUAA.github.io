# MM-LLMs: Recent Advances in MultiModal Large Language Models <!--(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09420.pdf)-->

We build a websit for the latest advances in MM-LLMs, [click here to visit the website](https://mm-llms.github.io/).

We aim to support researchers in MM-LLMs with our work, and we encourage everyone to contribute to the website by adding the latest MM-LLMS papers.
